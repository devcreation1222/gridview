                Raf Simons has always had a very intimate relationship to music, but his Autumn / Winter 2003 "Closer" collection can be considered his truest ode to the bands that have heavily influenced him since his childhood in Belgium. His collaboration that season
                with the archives of famed English graphic designer Peter Saville saw Simons borrowing graphics from bands like New Order, Joy Division, and Orchestral Maneuvers in the Dark. This iconography, paired with several unreleased images from
                Saville's portfolio, was placed on patches or hand-painted onto hoodies, coats, shirts, bags, etc. Much of the actual clothing was inspired by 80s staples of Manchester youth - trench coats, military parkas, classic tailoring, plaid driving
                caps and leather jackets.
