                It's hard to underestimate the influence of Raf Simon's Autumn / Winter 2001 "Riot, Riot, Riot" collection on contemporary fashion. This show marked Simon's official transition to primarily oversized garments and punkier DIY construction. Inspired by
                Eastern European youths layering oversized garments to stay warm in Viennese flea markets during harsh winters, Simons repurposed vintage oversized Fostex MA-1 bomber jackets, canvas military surplus belts, and Desert Storm-era shemaghs
                and sewed on patches with various cultural references identifiable by any alt-youth of the era. Additionally, garments were intentionally distressed to create holes and imperfections reminiscent of how punks dressed in the 1970's. Most
                importantly, however, this collection is credited with introducing exaggerated baggy silhouettes to the world of men's high fashion. Looking back now, some twenty years ahead in the future, its easy to decree that this collection changed
                not only what kinds of garments are being worn today, but also how they are being worn.
